THIS IS:
A tkinter course (python's most popular GUI module), i'm working on a repository which will include all the dependecies you need to master this Tkinter, with projects that will allow you to be a professional.
this repository aims the beginners and i'm sure that after i finish working on it, you guys will be grateful. i'll make sure that nobody give a negative remark about it once finished. Thanks in advance.
